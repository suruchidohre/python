        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        " a programming paradigm that organizes software design arond objects, ehich are data structures containing both data (attributes) and code (methods) that operate on that data promoting code reusability and modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "2. what is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  a blueprint or template creating objects , defining their attributes (data) and behaviors (methods)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "a fundamental unit that encapsulates data (attributes or propreties) and the operate on that data representing a real-world entity or concept within a proggram\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "  abstraction focuses on presenting only essential details and hiding complex implementation , white encapsulation bundles data and methods t\n",
        "  into a unit restricting direct access and promoting controlled access through methods\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "  in python a \"dunde\"r or \"magic\"method is a method that has double underscores before and after its name\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH\n",
        "\n",
        "  a mechanism where a new class (sub- class or derived class ) inherits properties and behaviors form an existing class (suuuperclass or base class) promoting code reuuse and hierarchical relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "  allows a specific rotine to use variables of different types at differnt times\n",
        "\n",
        "8 . How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "\n",
        " encapsulation is achieved by declaring a class data members and methods as either private oe protecteds\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "in python a constructor is a special method called when an object is created its purpose is to assignvalues to the data members within tha class when an aoject is initialized the name of the constructor method is always\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        " a class method is itself ( not on instance ), accessed  via the class name and typically used for creating new instances or method belongs to the class but is not bound to either the class or an instance and is used for utillty function that don't require  access to class or instance state\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "theability to define multiple methods of the same name but with different parameters in many object oriented programming languages\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "a language featre that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific  implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "a decorator feature in python wraps in a function appends several fnctionalities to existing code and then returns it\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        "it allows  object of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type enabling code reuusability flexibility and maintainabillity\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "a blueprint for other classes designed to be subclassed but not instantiated directly containing abstract methods (methods without implementation ) that subclasses must implement\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "improved code organization through encapsulation reusability via inheritance ,flexibility with polymorphism and simplification of complex systems through abstraction leading to moduular maintainable and scalable software\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "a class variable (also known as a static variable is shared by all instances (object) of a class while an instance variable is unique to each instance\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "\n",
        " allows a class to inherit attributed and methods from more than one parent class combining fnctionalities from differnt base classes into a single derived class\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "this ensures that objects have meaningful string representations for both and developers\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "allows access to methods and properties of a parent or superclass from a child or subclass\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        " the del statement is used to delete objects variable list elements or attributes of objects\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "a class method takes cls as the first parameter white a static method needs on specific parametes\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "lets objects of diverse type share the same interface empowering method to be executed unexpectedly based on the object type\n",

        "calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object in a sinle expression\n",
